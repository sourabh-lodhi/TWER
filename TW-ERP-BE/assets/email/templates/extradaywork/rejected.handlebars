<body>
	<p>Dear {{name}},</p>

	<p>Thank you for your recent request to work an additional day to complete the project for our client on
		{{fromDate}} to {{endDate}}. I
		appreciate your dedication to the success of our projects and your commitment to meeting our clients' needs.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, after careful consideration, Due to {{reason}}, I am unable to approve the additional workday at
		this time. We have
		carefully reviewed our project timelines and work schedules and determined that the requested date conflicts
		with other important priorities and commitments.</p>

	<p>I understand that this news may be disappointing, but please know that we have carefully weighed all the factors
		involved in making this decision. I also want to assure you that we remain fully committed to completing the
		project on time and to the highest standards of quality.</p>

	<p>Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this decision, and I will do my best to address
		them. Thank you again for your hard work and dedication to our company.</p>

	<p>Sincerely,</p>

	<p>{{appovedBy}}</p>
